In this project, I presented a case study on automatically detecting whether a student is at-risk of dropout at New Jersey City University using R and R Markdown report.

Models: Bagging, Stacking with Random Forest, Classification Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

These models achieve high predictive power, combining values of AUC ROC for decision-making with capable of achieving with accuracy score of over 96% in its predictions.

The goal of this project is to take a look inside into the U.S flight delay data by using many various visualizations such as chart, donut, force, choropleth map to answer these questions: how does the total number of flight delay change, which airport has the most flight delay, the relationship between origin and destination airports.

Technology: HTML5, CSS6, JavaScript, and d3.

The target of this project is to identify vehicles by detecting and recognizing their license plates. Results can be used for vehicle tracking and vehicle activity analysis.

I trained various neural networks from pre-trained CNNs (Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19) with different architectures, and hyperparameters. VGG16 models showed the best accuracy score with 84% recognition rate.

#### Project on Employee Database Management System

Objective is to set up an employee information system with data such as the status of employees, departments, leave, salary.

Collected entities, tables, and data types, and designed a relational database to store the data.
