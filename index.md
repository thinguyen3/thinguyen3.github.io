In this project, I presented a case study on automatically detecting whether a student is at-risk of dropout at New Jersey City University using R and R Markdown report.

I applied several machine learning algorithms such as Bagging, Stacking with Random Forest, Classification Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM to find the best student dropout prediction model, these models achieve high predictive power, combining values of AUC ROC for decision-making with capable of achieving with accuracy score of over 96% in its predictions.

The target of this project is to identify vehicles by detecting and recognizing their license plates. Results can be used for vehicle tracking and vehicle activity analysis.

I trained various neural networks from pre-trained CNNs (Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19) with different architectures, and hyperparameters. VGG16 models showed the best accuracy score with 84% recognition rate.
